- **OCR Processing**: Extracts text from images using custom made deep learning models.
- **Book List**: Displays a list of detected book titles from scanned images.
- **Save and Search**: Store scanned book titles locally and search through your collection.

## Technologies Used

- **Expo**: Framework for building React Native apps with minimal setup.
- **NestJS**: Node.js framework for building the backend API.
- **PostgreSQL**: Open-source relational database for storing book data.
- **YoloV5**: Deep learning model for object detection in images.
- **CRNN**: Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network for text recognition.
